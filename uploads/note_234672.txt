Introduction 

1.1 Background of the Study 

Social media has become an integral part of modern society, revolutionizing the way individuals communicate, share information, and interact. From its early days as a tool for personal connections, it has evolved into a multifaceted platform influencing various aspects of life, including culture, politics, education, business, and mental health. The rapid proliferation of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok has created a dynamic and interconnected world where ideas spread at an unprecedented speed. 

The impact of social media on society is multifaceted, encompassing both positive and negative dimensions. On one hand, social media has democratized access to information, provided a platform for marginalized voices, and facilitated global connectivity. It has also proven to be a powerful tool for social movements, enabling the mobilization of communities and the dissemination of critical messages. 

On the other hand, concerns have been raised about its potential adverse effects. Issues such as misinformation, cyberbullying, privacy violations, and the addictive nature of social media platforms have sparked debates about its societal implications. Moreover, excessive use of social media has been linked to mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and loneliness, particularly among younger users. 

Given its pervasive influence, studying the impact of social media on society is crucial to understanding its role in shaping social behavior, relationships, and institutional structures. This research aims to explore these dynamics, examining both the beneficial and detrimental effects of social media on individuals and communities. The findings will contribute to ongoing discussions about how to harness social media’s potential while mitigating its risks. 

This study aims to explore the multifaceted impact of social media on society, examining both its positive contributions and its potential drawbacks. By understanding the nuanced ways in which social media shapes social behaviors, mental health, and cultural norms.  

1.2 Statement of the Problem 

Social media has transformed the way people interact, communicate, and access information, influencing nearly every aspect of daily life. While it has brought numerous benefits, such as fostering global connections, democratizing information, and providing platforms for self-expression, it has also raised significant concerns. 

One major issue is the role of social media in spreading misinformation and fostering polarization, which can undermine social cohesion and trust in institutions. Additionally, excessive social media use has been linked to mental health challenges, such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Cyberbullying, privacy breaches, and the addictive nature of these platforms further complicate the societal impact of social media. 

Moreover, the effects of social media are not uniform and vary based on factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and cultural context. Despite its widespread use, there is still limited understanding of the extent to which social media shapes behavior, influences mental health, and affects societal dynamics. 

This research seeks to address these gaps by examining the complex impact of social media on society. It aims to identify both the positive contributions and the challenges posed by these platforms, providing insights that can inform policy development, user behavior, and platform design to foster a healthier and more equitable digital environment.

Literature review 

Vanden Boogart (2006) analyzed the responses of 3134 students in a study conducted at four universities to examine the effect of Facebook on campus life at four higher education institutions. He discovered important correlations between the amount of time spent on Facebook and a variety of demographic factors. Females spent much more time on Facebook than males. Students with a GPA of 2.99 or lower said they spent more time on Facebook than students with higher GPAs. 

Ahmad (2011) According to his research Social networking sites provide many benefits to their users, including the ability to stay in contact with peers and reconnect with old ones. As a result, the global social media network is expanding. 

Wodzicki et al. (2012) pointed out that social media can help students improve self-directed learning skills by providing a forum for them to explore subjects and gather information by accessing existing data on the internet or engaging with like-minded students to constructively share ideas and create awareness through informal and formal activities. 

Kim & Khang (2014) it was discovered that social media has a positive impact on building and maintaining relationships among users, which aids in meeting students' academic needs. International students, in particular, profit more from using social media and forming new relationships that aid their academic success. 

Naher and Minar in their research looked at certain case studies in Bangladesh where real-life violence was sparked by Facebook activities. Facebook was mostly used to incite hatred and violence in those situations, whether purposefully or unintentionally. Ali [10] discovered how Facebook users use the platform to increase violence in society. It was found that most of the time, people react without even checking the facts of the post in the first place. 

Tezer et al (2017) have researched to examine students' general attitudes toward the use of social media in light of socio-demographic variables such as their class, gender, academic history of their parents, socio-economic status, memberships in social media tools, social media contexts, and, finally, tools used to link social media accounts. Students' attitudes toward using social media were found to be strong and optimistic, according to the report. 

Mastrodicasa and Metellus (2013) define social networking sites as the websites that allow users to connect to one another based on shared interests, activities, or characteristics. Thus, Facebook, YouTube, blogs, Twitter, MySpace, or LinkedIn are some of the most frequently visited social networking websites by the young generation now-a-days. 

Fahmy and Wanta (2007) studied visual journalist what they think and what the others think and the impact of news photographs on public opinion formation. They found the result that visual journalists believe their work can have powerful effects on the public under certain circumstances and their findings indicate homogeneous attitudes towards the impact of visual messages on the public (Fahmy & Wanta, 2007, p. 16). 

Adami and Jewitt (2016) traced four themes across their study on visual communication and social media. Transmedia circulation, appropriation, and control are the last theme of their study. Last theme means Digital technologies afford text creation through ‘copy-and-paste’ across media. As results visuals are easily assembled, bricolage, edited, manipulated, and reused, from one media to another (Adami & Jewitt, 2016, p. 3-5). 

Tapscott (1998) talks of growing up in a digital environment referring to the youth as the Net Generation. Children are socializing in a hybrid virtual space, learning in innovative ways, creating a new language and practicing multicultural values. The main characteristics of the “N-Gen” culture are: independence, emotional and intellectual openness, inclusion, free expression and strong views, innovative, preoccupation with maturity,
